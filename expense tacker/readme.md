# 💸 Expense Tracker (Python CLI Project)

Hi 👋  
This is a **simple Expense Tracker** that I built while learning **Python, OOPS, and file handling**.

The main purpose of this project was to understand **how real programs store data, manage state, and persist information even after the program is closed**.

---

## 🧠 What this project does

This is a **command-line (CLI) application** that allows you to:

- ➕ Add daily expenses (amount, category, note)
- 📋 View all recorded expenses
- 📊 Calculate total spending
- 🗂️ See category-wise expense summary
- 💾 Store data permanently using a CSV file

The data is saved in a **CSV file**, which means it can be easily opened in **Excel** or used later with **Pandas** for data analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)  
- File Handling (CSV)  
- Command Line Interface (CLI)
